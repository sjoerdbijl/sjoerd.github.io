This may look like a funny designed logo, maybe not even so professionally drawn picture, but its powers will surprise you, it’s Anki!

Anki!! Even with in the first weeks of using it I noticed the results; not only my grades went up by studying less, but I generally felt less stressed, I started gaining confidence and being more passionate about things in my daily life, my acne went away after some time and it even led me to getting me my very first girlfriend!
Now I hear you think, this sounds quite remarkable, and it is quite remarkable, or it would be since none of these things are really so true.

Nevertheless this thing has done quite something for me concerning language learning, instead of making you remember the meaning of concepts it basically just teaches you..."Things". Sounds weird right? Since at least in the western world education aims to teach you the meaning of concepts, rather than just remembering stuff, Anki is useful for learning the actual keyword when you already understand the concept behind it, or something that just has no concept behind it at all.

What is it?

It kinda works like normal flashcards, except it will work more efficiently and you can do cool stuff with the cards





So for what it's really useful then?

In the Anki community there are generally three groups: People using it in their medschool studies, language learners, and people trying to learn everything. Myself I fit in the second group (Although I have been thinking about using it for the 3rd group as well). Med school students need to remember a bunch of "things"
