Anki!! Even with in the first weeks  of using it I noticed the results; not only my grades went up by studying less, but I generally felt less stressed, I started gaining confidence and being more passionate about things in general, my acne went away after some time and it even let me to getting me my first girlfriend!
Now I hear you think, this sounds quite remarkable, and it is quite remarkable, or it would be since none of these things above are true other than me being in school.
