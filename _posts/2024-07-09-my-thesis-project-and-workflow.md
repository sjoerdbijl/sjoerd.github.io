I wrote my thesis on [product recommendations](https://github.com/sjoerdbijl/Thesis-project). Data collected from [GOAT](https://www.goat.com/en-nl).

With my current knowledge I wouldn't have used several csv files but instead write everything to MYSQL or a similar database and go on from there. There was a lot of clumsiness in collecting and preparing the data.  This also motivated me to brush up some technical skills around data management and analysis.
