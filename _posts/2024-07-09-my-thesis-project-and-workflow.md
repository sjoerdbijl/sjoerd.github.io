I wrote my thesis on [product recommendations](https://github.com/sjoerdbijl/Thesis-project). Data collected from [GOAT](https://www.goat.com/en-nl).

The Github page shows the workflow of collecting the data and organizing it run by separate R scripts. This controls the phases between data preparation and analysis. 
The files are connected through a makefile script that can be run in the command prompt.

With my current knowledge, I realize that using deeper technical skills a database like MySQL would have been more efficient than relying on multiple CSV files. This insight has inspired me to improve my technical skills in data management and analysis.
