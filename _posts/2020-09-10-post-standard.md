This may look like a funny designed logo, maybe not even so professionally drawn picture, but its powers will surprise you, it’s Anki!

Anki! Even with in the first weeks of using it I noticed the results; not only my grades went up by studying less, but I generally felt less stressed, I started gaining confidence and being more passionate about things, my acne went away after some time and it even let me to getting me, my first girlfriend! Now I hear you think, this sounds quite remarkable, and it is quite remarkable, or it would be since none of these things above are true other than me being in school; I didn’t hear about this thing in high school, and thinking back whether it would’ve made a difference… not sure to be honest. This program is not magic, but it helps you get to some goals in learning, see it as a really high-quality tool, so like a normal tool, let’s say a drilling tool.

what is it?
An advanced, smarter form of Quizlet, I think a lot of people have used some form of this style of flash-card learning before, either in real form by writing words on two opposite sides or like me, by using some form of flashcard program to remember words before an exam. 
The biggest difference is the usage of the holy term: spaced repetition. Anki is smart enough to memorize which cards you remembered before and is too easy for you, a bit like a teacher you bond with really well, and challenges you with questions they think are on your level. The biggest advantage is that in this way there is no need to remember which you won’t remember tomorrow. The best way to show what it does is by this example.

On the first day when you learn something new let’s say you are not familiar with one these five words:
dove: white bird
illustration: a drawing 
dream: visions in your sleep
oxymoron: a word followed by a contradiction in a sentence
battery: storage of electricity in a capsule

The following day this may happen in your mind

dove: white bird
illustration: a drawing 
dream: visions in your sleep
oxymoron: a word followed by a contradiction in a sentence
battery: storage of electricity in a capsule
One word is fading away and you are about to forget it. In order to keep it in your mind, you will need to answer the question: “What is the definition of a dove”?  
The next day this may be your mind
dove: white bird
illustration: a drawing 
dream: visions in your sleep
oxymoron: a word followed by a contradiction in a sentence
battery: storage of electricity in a capsule
No fading! This means that this time you don’t even need to be asked about it, you can wait another day with this word to stop making it fade.
This is not unique either, programs such as Memrise and Duolingo use this same algorithm, but shortly said Anki is king because it’s free and open-source and it doesn’t force you into using some limited, inefficient, buggy, and paid program. I want to talk about myself and how I’ve been learning Russian with it.
Russian is a difficult language to learn, it’s possibly the easiest language to learn however for a funny looking alphabet. I went to Russia last year and took 3 months to start studying it, my journey began and I haven’t stopped yet. The only real reason I’m still interested and able in learning it is that I set up the system of Anki with it, which makes it incredibly easy to just spend some time a day reviewing words.

What do I know?
I know a list of  2500 Russian words, these are mostly roots of words, with some words that 
Besides this, I did not ignore all English translated words in Russian FYI: the Russian language has a lot of borrowed words that are either very similar to the English language or just the same but in the weird-looking letters.
Examples of this are:
-спортсмен
sportsman
Штаб
staff
Milk
молоко

I actually don’t know all of them yet, I would say the real number is closer to 2000, as the algorithm puts my words in requires me to make multiple steps in a word before I truly remember it, cards get “upgraded” ones I pick the right answer only after 5 times in a row. And you can imagine that like In some game where you get send back after a wrong answer, this can take a long time before you get it right. The positive side is that in this case once I know the cards I am quite likely to get them right…well that’s in theory, in practice, I noticed that it was a bit more difficult to manage. 
The ultimate goal is to get a good score in your cards because once you can get the cards after some time-lets say 2 months-this means that you are very unlikely to forget it for the next year or so, or maybe a lifetime depending on the emotional value of your card. The problems I ran into can be put in a list of personal failure with a huge amount of dwelling:
-badly designed cards
-clicking 
-boredom and clicking on the "wrong" button too fast
-mistyping one fucking ь sign
-mistakes in the newly created cards for over 8 times
-guessing the synonym

All these things happened often and negatively affected my score. 
It’s also so tempting to just click away from that card on “good” once you get only one letter wrong that you really almost want to do it.

Next steps
Going back to the card design and improvement of my technique, these points are not that difficult to tackle, and with some decency, I can get a better score going. 
I thought of 10 cards/day easy, and it really WAS easy, after making a mnemonic for cards they do really get easier, and you notice that they stick with you longer than any other word.
 until you have a stressed-out day where Anki is your last endpoint, and it's dark and cold and you are alone in your room behind a desktop pc doing internet flashcards with 200 more to go for that day, and you still need to come up with like 10 funny and creative little stories. These concepts take some creative energy that in my case doesn’t work in such environments, only when I’m totally relaxed I can come up with some mnemonics which would help me in remembering it faster.  

I did get 10 cards every single day, however, and sometimes this increased my time sitting and doing these cards a lot. Sometimes even I tried to force them angrily inside my head but forcing doesn’t work for vocab so much as taking the time and rehearsing them in your head, all of this leads to a longer process of reviewing which in the end doesn’t pay off for your score.


What’s to fix?
Most of the fixing will be for me, honestly, the hardest part about making this post true is my own mind flipping against it, also when you are thinking of posting something like this then in your mind it all seems so obvious and great to talk for over 5000 words, but in reality, you know it’s quite hard to make it happen for the reason that so many words mean you do need to say something, right now I’m not saying a lot, and I mean I’m not always in the greatest state of ideas either though you should definitely be before making such a post. Anyway, I found that during my journey of doing these cards not once I was really troubled by actually doing the process of the cards-that was pretty easy you know, the hard part is that improving your cards constantly is probably the best thing to do, but it’s hard to both consistently do your cards-something that you don’t really need a head for anymore once you get used to typing and clicking on the cards, but the actual act of editing the format of the cards is so much harder for a reason, though you just have to search a few things on the internet and make a few connections in your head on how to do it, this energy and motivation somehow is different, and doesn’t come out of discipline, so at the end, it felt like doing both at the same time would be quite impossible to manage. 
I don’t know whether these shortcomings really mattered to most and whether they impact your results, but it felt like they kind of had an impact on the way I was doing the cards at some time.

Anyway, I apparently only know just about 10,000 words in English, which is not a lot-Native speakers do reach up to 25,000 in their lifetimes. So there's that.
